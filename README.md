### How to use
Activate the addon in the project settings' addon tab,
Drag the SmoothScroll-Scene (`res://addons/SmoothScroll/SmoothScroll.tscn`) into your scene and add any Control-Node as a child for the scroll's content.
<br>
Do NOT add the scene by the "Create Node" tab. This won't work.

**Currently only supports one Control node as content-child!**
